<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>ADDRESSING MODES</h1>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Immediate</h3>
<p>MOV AL,10</p>
<p>Copy a number into a register. This is the simplest move command and easy to 
  understand.</p>
<h3>Direct (register)</h3>
<p>MOV AL,BL</p>
<p>Copy one register into another. This is easy to understand. The simulator does 
  not support this command. If you have to copy from one register to another, 
  use a RAM location or the stack to achieve the move.</p>
<h3>Direct (memory)</h3>
<p>MOV AL,[50]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; Copy from RAM into AL. Copy the data from 
  address 50.<br>
  MOV [50],AL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; Copy from AL into RAM. Copy the data to 
  address 50.</p>
<p>The square brackets indicate data in RAM. The number in the square brackets 
  indicates the RAM address/location of the data.</p>
<h3>Indirect</h3>
<p>MOV AL,[BL]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; Copy from RAM into AL. Copy from the address 
  that BL points to.<br>
  MOV [BL],AL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; Copy from AL into RAM. Copy to the address 
  that BL points to.</p>
<p>Copy between a specified RAM location and a register. The square brackets indicate 
  data in RAM. In this example BL points to RAM.</p>
<h3>Indexed</h3>
<p>MOV AL,[20 + BL]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; Copy from RAM into AL. The RAM address 
  is located at 20+BL.<br>
  MOV [20 + BL],AL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; Copy from AL into RAM. The RAM address 
  is located at 20+BL.</p>
<p>Here the BL register is used to &quot;index&quot; data held in a table. The 
  table data starts at address 20.</p>
<h3>Base Register</h3>
<p>MOV AL,[BL+SI]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; Copy from RAM into AL. The RAM address 
  is located at BL+SI.<br>
  MOV [BL+SI],AL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; Copy from AL into RAM. The RAM address 
  is located at BL+SI.</p>
<p>BL is the &quot;base register&quot;. It holds the start address of a data table. 
  SI is the &quot;source index&quot;. It is used to index a record in the data 
  table. </p>
