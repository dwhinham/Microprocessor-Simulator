<h3>Bugs and Features</h3>
<p>Here are some bugs and features that I know about.</p>
<p>If you discover other problems, please send me an <a href="mailto:nbauers@samphire.demon.co.uk">E 
  Mail</a>.</p>
<p>I will cure the easy bugs and list the hard ones here.</p>
<h3> Why is my display messed up?</h3>
<p>The simulator was developed using the default windows fonts, colours and borders. 
  Some combinations of colours, fonts and window borders have caused problems. 
  The symptoms include invisible text, text that won't fit inside the window, 
  labels that don't line up with the item they are supposed to label and stretched 
  bitmap images that look untidy. The cure is to use Windows default settings 
  or compatible settings.</p>
<h3> Where are my windows?</h3>
<p> Beginners and some experts might hit another problem. With the display in 
  a high resolution mode, the simulator windows can be moved towards the bottom 
  right. When the display is restored to a lower resolution and the simulator 
  is re-started, all its windows will be off screen where thay can't be seen or 
  controlled. The cure is to close the simulator and delete Sms32V50.INI. The 
  simulator will restart with its windows in default visible positions.</p>
<h3> Why won't this file save? &quot;Sms32v50.Ini&quot;</h3>
<p> This is common on a network installation. Make sure the working directory 
  is one that you have permission to write to.</p>
<h3>Why can't I save my work?</h3>
<p>Make sure you are saving to a folder or directory where you have write permission. 
  This problem usually occurs when you are running the simulator from a network 
  installation.</p>
