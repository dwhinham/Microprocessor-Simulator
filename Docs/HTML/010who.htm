<h3>Who Should Use the Simulator</h3>
<p>The simulator is intended for any student studying low level programming, control 
  or machine architecture for the first time. </p>
<p>The simulator can be used by students aged 14 to 16 to solve less complex problems 
  such as controlling the traffic lights and snake. </p>
<p>More advanced students typically 16 or older can solve quite complex low level 
  programming problems involving conditional jumps, procedures, software and hardware 
  interrupts and Boolean logic. Although programs will be small, there is good 
  scope for modular design and separation of code and data tables.</p>
<p>The simulator is suitable for courses such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>BTEC National Diploma for IT Practitioners (Computer Systems and Control 
    Technology)</li>
  <li>AS and A2 Computing (Low Level Programming)</li>
  <li>Electronics Courses.</li>
  <li>Courses involving microcontrollers.</li>
  <li>Courses involving control systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Description of the Simulator</h3>
<p>The simulator includes a small sub-set of the full instruction set normally found with this style of processor. It includes advanced instructions such as CALL, 
  RET, INT and IRET. There is a hardware timer interrupt simulation too.</p>
<p>This simulator emulates an eight bit CPU that is similar to the low eight bits 
  of the 80x86 family of chips. 256 bytes of RAM are simulated. It is surprising 
  how much can be done with only 256 bytes or RAM.</p>
<p>The simulator is licensed under GNU / GPL making it freely available for use by students and educational institutions at zero cost.</p>
<h3> Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>8 bit CPU</li>
  <li>16 Input Output ports. Not all are used.</li>
  <li>Simulated peripherals on ports 0 to 5.</li>
  <li>An assembler.</li>
  <li> On-line help.</li>
  <li>Single step through programs.</li>
  <li>Continuously run programs.</li>
  <li> Interrupt 02 triggered by a hardware timer (simulated).</li>
  <li>CPU Clock Speed can be altered.</li>
</ul>
