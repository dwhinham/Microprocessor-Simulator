<h2>Important</h2>
<p>FIRST make a back-up copy of the distribution disk or downloaded file. </p>
<p>Print and file Userinfo.Reg. This contains your registration key.</p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>Sms32V50.Exe requires Windows95/98/NT/2000/XP. A mouse or other pointing device 
  is highly recommended to access the hypertext help pages.</p>
<h3> To Install</h3>
<p>You don't need to run setup. In fact there is no setup program.</p>
<p>Make a folder for all the simulator files and copy them from the distribution 
  disk to this directory. If you have downloaded a Zip file, unzip it into this 
  directory.</p>
<p>Create a shortcut to sms32v50.exe and/or create a shortcut on the start menu. 
</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>In a School College or University setting, the exercise files should be made 
  available to students. These files are numbered as in this example - 02tlight.asm 
  and 99snake.asm. The other example files demonstrate the capabilities of the 
  simulator and are typical of the sorts of programs students might write for 
  assignments. DEMO.ASM could be made available.</p>
<p>The other example files should be kept by the teacher for reference.</p>
<p>Note <strong>Userinfo.reg</strong>, if available, should be in the same directory 
  as Sms32V50.Exe. Userinfo.reg contains the registration key that you need to 
  run the simulator as a registered program. When Userinfo.reg is missing or faulty, 
  the simulator runs in shareware mode. When you register, you will get instructions 
  relating to Userinfo.reg. This file has nothing to do with the Windows registry. 
  It is a text file containing the key. The name is a hangover from the days of 
  Windows 3.11 when there were no registries.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The on line help should be in the same directory as Sms32V50.Exe</p>
<h3>Network Installation</h3>
<p>The simulator has been designed to run from a server. It does not need to be 
  installed on workstations. This makes deployment simple. One day all software 
  will be like this and stressed out network administrators will revert to being 
  normal, kind, cheerful human beings.</p>
<p>Create a read only folder on the server and make sure all users can access 
  it. (Create a share or use a public drive). Copy all the files from the distribution 
  into the folder on the server. If they are zipped, unzip them. Provide a shortcut 
  to sms32v50.exe for users to start up the program. The shortcut should specify 
  a working directory where users have write permission such as their home folder.</p>
<p>Users need write access to their own home folder (a floppy disk would be OK 
  too). Users need to save their work to this folder (or floppy). If the simulator 
  starts in this directory, it will save an INI file in the user's directory that 
  holds information about window positions and preferences. If the INI file is 
  missing, the simulator will start with default settings and will attempt to 
  create the INI file. If SMS starts in a read only directory, it will not be 
  able to save its INI file. If possible, correct this non fatal problem. </p>
<h3>To Run</h3>
<p>If you have set up an icon, double click the icon or select the icon and press 
  enter. You can double click on Sms32V50.exe within Windows Explorer or My Computer. 
  You can drag and drop an assembly code file onto the program icon. Assembly 
  code file names should end in .asm. You can drop any type of file into the simulator 
  but the result is not likely to be useful. </p>
